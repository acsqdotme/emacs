* emacs config

** why not vim?

While I'm very satisfied with [[https://www.lunarvim.org/][lunarvim]] as an IDE and native cli git
for VC, I kinda hate caldav and finding a frontend for my [[https://radicale.org/v3.html][radicale]]
server.

I'm learning emacs for mostly for org-agenda but I'm also exploring
org-roam and magit.

** how I got started

Got a cool base config with org-babel from [[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2044Ew-UVVv31a0-Qn3dA6Sd_-NyA1n&si=FHsyEvbLXbTQHiyC][uncle dave]] and lots of
really cool show cases from [[https://systemcrafters.net/][system crafters]]. The best channel I've
seen with showcasing emacs features is [[https://www.youtube.com/@protesilaos/][protesilaos]].
